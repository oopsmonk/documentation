# IOTA 1.5 Chrysalis

This documentation outlines the current and upcoming updates to the IOTA environment.

## What it is

IOTA 1.5, better known as [Chrysalis](https://blog.iota.org/release-strategy-for-chrysalis-iota-1-5-4ea8741ea3a1/), is an intermediate update between the pre and present [**Coordicide**](https://coordicide.iota.org/post-coordinator) that will dually make our services more manageable for users while improving performance and quality.

With these two factors, Chrysalis will overall lessen the level of effort used for both sides.

## What it will do

As mentioned above, Chrysalis provides a good transition to Coordicide, or IOTA 2.0. Chrysalis updates are not simply stop-gap updates but also provide substantial performance improvements, an improved development experience, and an accelerated adoption.

## What is being updated

The implementation of Chyrsalis is broken up intwo two phases:

**Phase 1**

- Unified Random Tip Selection (URTS)
- Milestone selection
- White Flag
- Autopeering

These updates produce:

- Transaction confirmation times of around 10 seconds
- Transactions that very rarely need reattachment
- A substantial TPS increase on mainnet
- Performance and relability improvement for nodes
- Reduced node setup times 

**Phase 2**

- Unspent Transaction Output
- Atomic, reusable addresses
- Binary

These updates produce

- Reusable addresses and support for more standard cryptography (EdDSA), making hardware support for all major arechitectures possible
- Simplified transaction layout and a reduction in transaction size, further increasing performance
- Introudction of features such as tokenized assets
- Significant improvements to the usability and relaibility of IOTA
