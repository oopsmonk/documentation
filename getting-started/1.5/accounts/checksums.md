# Checksums

**A checksum is the name given to the [trytes](../the-tangle/ternary.md) that are appended to the end of an address or a seed. This topic discusses what checksums are for and what they look like.**

Checksums are often appended to addresses and seeds in user interfaces such as wallets to help you to detect typos.

Changing a single tryte in a seed or a checksum results in a completely different checksum.

## Checksum format

The length of a checksum depends on whether it's for an address or a seed. Address checksums are 9 trytes long, whereas seed checksums are 3 trytes long. The reason for this difference is that mistyping an address can lead to sending IOTA tokens to the wrong address, so the checksum must be more resistant to [collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_(computer_science)).
